# hello-world
This is the first, hopefully of many.

Suibhne here. I just started coding this April; enjoying it so far. I'm a student at the University of Michigan, Ross School of Businessâ€”Class of 2022, hoping to make a career out of entreprenuership in the social computing/technology space. Starting with web development and hopefully moving on to other things afterwards (thinking python as of now). Want to be able to create amazing things and solve tangible solutions using these skills. If anyone has any suggestions for me to meet my goals, please share any wisdom you're willing to impart. 

Thank you and godbless, Suibhne.
